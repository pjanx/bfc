===

'bfc' is a small, fast, self-contained, optimizing Brainfuck compiler for Linux
on Intel x86-64.

Also included are several interpreters in various states of sophistication that
document my progress as I was writing this, from the simplest approach to an
optimizing JIT compiler.

It's pretty easy to retarget the compiler, it just means redoing half the work.
The compiler itself is platform agnostic.

Building
--------
Build dependencies: a C99 compiler +
Runtime dependencies: Linux

 $ git clone https://github.com/pjanouch/bfc.git
 $ cd bfc
 $ make

To obtain dumps of the intermediate representation, compile with `-DDEBUG`:

 $ make CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG

Usage
-----

 ./bfc-amd64-linux [INPUT-FILE] [OUTPUT-FILE]

When no input file is specified, standard input is used.  Similarly, the default
output filename is `a.out`.  After the compilation, the resulting file can be
run on the target platform.
