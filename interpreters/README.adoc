This directory contains several Brainfuck interpreters in various states of
sophistication, from the simplest approach to an optimizing JIT compiler:

 * `bf.c` is the stupidest one and the oldest by far
 * `bf-faster-loops.c` precomputes loop jumps
 * `bf-optimizing.c` improves on that by changing `[-]+` loops into assignments
 * `bf-jit.c` adds JIT compilation for Intel x86-64
 * `bf-jit-opt.c` tries a bit harder to avoid looping on the current value
 * `bf-jit-unsafe.c` abolishes all boundary checks when moving across the tape
 * `bf-jit-unsafe-opt.c` makes use of immediate offsets to modify values

I recommend using a tool such as _meld_ to view the differences.

Just run `make` in this directory to have them all built, and append
`CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG` to get dumps of the IR for the more sophisticated JITs.
The interpreters take the program on standard input and read characters
directly from the terminal device, so to run a simple `cat`-like program,
you can do:

 $ echo ',[.,]' | ./bf
